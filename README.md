---

## Overview

In this project, a voice-interactive 3D mobile game was developed for children with semantic language disorder and articulation disorder. The aim of the project is to support therapy processes digitally by strengthening children's contextual comprehension and correct pronunciation skills through a game-based method. Built with the Unity game engine, this platformer-style game has the player progress through levels by solving puzzles using voice commands. The player's voice is detected using the Vosk speech recognition library; correct word pronunciations are checked in real time to enable in-game interaction. The game structure is customizable by therapists based on target words, making it an effective tool that combines both learning and therapeutic benefits.
